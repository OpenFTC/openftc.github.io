OpenRC is a modified version of the ftc_app SDK. It is maintained by members of the OpenFTC community.
The goal of OpenRC is to add extra features and functionality to the official SDK,
while being careful not to break existing functionality.

In an official Relic Recovery game forum ruling, using modified libraries from the official SDK
was ruled illegal. So, we built a feature that will let you switch to the official, unmodified libraries
before you go to a competition. [See here for details](buildvariants).
