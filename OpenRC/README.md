# OpenRC

[OpenRC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC) is a modified version of the ftc_app Software Development Kit
(SDK), maintained by members of the OpenFTC community. The goal of OpenRC is to improve the development
experience for teams, while providing a quick-and-easy path to install a competition-legal version of the
app. See our page on [competition legality](legality).

In addition to the [normal version of OpenRC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC), we also have a
[Turbo version](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC-turbo). **Both** versions are significantly faster to build
than the official app (as of version 3.6), but the Turbo version takes the speed improvement much further,
and completely strips out the Blocks and OnBotJava features, that most Android Studio users don't use.

When a new release of the official SDK comes out, both OpenRC and OpenRC-turbo will be updated to it within
a week.
